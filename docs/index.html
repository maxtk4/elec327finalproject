							<h3>Magpie</h3>
							<p>This is Magpie, the aircraft designed to function with this payload. It first takes off carrying a payload attached to the velcro plate below it.
								When Magpie approaches the designated landing zone where it is attempting to deliver the payload, It lands vertically. The payload senses Magpie has landed,
								and retracts its velcro top, separating it from the bottom of Magpie's attachment plate. Once the aircraft has flown away, the payload once agai extends this plate,
							     such that another aircraft can pick up the payload by landing on top of the velcro.

							<h3>Payload Design</h3>
							<p>The payload is designed around an MSPM0G3507 microcontroller, connected to Neopixel LEDs, a linear servo, and two limit switches. The microcontroller and surrounding
								circuitry are powered via two buck converters outputing 3.3V for the microcontroller and 5V for the servo and Neopixels. The buck regulators are powered with 7.4 Volts nominal from
								a 2 cell lithium polymer battery. The schematic and layout are in the github repository for the project, however we were unable to get the MCU to flash due to the passive components
								being wired incorrectly.

						<div class="content">
							<h3>Hitec Linear Servo</h3>
							<p>The payload uses this Hitec servo to extend and retract the payload. It communicates through varying length PWM commands, which are configured by setting
								the CC_01 register, which changes the duty cycle of the PWM output from the PWM register.
